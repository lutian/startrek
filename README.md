# Selfie with StarTrek!
### Take a selfie with Captain Kirk and Spock with Python, OpenCv e MediaPipe

### MediaPipe 
We use MediPipe for 2 reassons:
* Segmentation Mask: to crop our image on scene
* Right Hand Landmarks: to capture gesture of hands to take a picture

### How to use:
When run the scripts, you have to say hello in startrek way. 
Then, captain Kirk, Spock and Khan will appear infront the camera.
Now you have to do "like" signal with right hand to countdown starts and take a selfie
To reset you have to do "V" signal with your right hand.
Just scan with your phone and you will get access to your selfie!
Scripts have f*ckyou avoid, I mean you can't take selfie if show the middle finger to the camera =)

I hope you enjoy it!
